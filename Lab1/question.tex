\section{Write a detailed explanation why computation load can be imbalanced and how it affects the global performance. \\\textit{Hint: What is necessary to compute a black pixel, as opposed to a colored pixel?}}
Pixel take different amount of time to calculate, for example ff the number is stable and does not diverge,  the pixel is black. Therefore it will iterate MAXITER iteration to calculate it.  But if the number diverges it will  run the calculation a few times.
So, the calculation for a pixel that diverges fast or a stable pixel, will have quite the difference computer load than a pixel that diverges fast. 

\section{Describe different load-balancing methods that would help reducing the performance
loss due to load-imbalance. You should be able to come up with at least two.
\textit{Hint: Observe that the load-balancing method must be valid for any picture computed, not only the default picture.}}
